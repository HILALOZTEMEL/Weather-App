# Weather App

### Project Requirements:

* OpenWeatherMap API integration
* UI design using StoryBoard
* Implementation of MVVM architecture
* Unit testing
* Deep linking

### Project Description:
The project involves reading the location data of the user based on the API Key provided, 
and displaying the current weather conditions and 7-day weather forecast for the region. 
The application will use the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data and display it in the UI designed using StoryBoard. 
The MVVM architecture will be used to ensure a separation of concerns and a clean codebase. 
Unit testing will be implemented to ensure the quality of the code and avoid any potential bugs. 
Additionally, deep linking will be used to allow users to easily share specific weather information with others.
